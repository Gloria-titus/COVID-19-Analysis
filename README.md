# COVID-19 Data Analysis

A Jupyter Notebook project that explores COVID-19 case data using Python. The goal is to analyze the spread of the virus, identify trends, and draw insights from global datasets.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze COVID-19 confirmed case trends over time
- Visualize the geographic distribution of cases
- Compare the spread in various countries
- Practice data cleaning, transformation, and visualization in Python

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gloria-titus/covid-analysis.git
   cd covid-analysis



2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

    ```bash
   jupyter notebook Covid.


3. Run all cells from top to bottom to view outputs and visualizations.



**💡 Insights & Reflections**
-The virus spread in waves, with major spikes in early 2020 and subsequent years.

-Some countries had earlier peaks while others had prolonged outbreaks.

-Data visualization played a key role in understanding trends and anomalies.
